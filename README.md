# idg1293-portfolio

## Oblig 1 improved
TO DO:
- Fix path to image of lady in hero section (/components/hero-section.scss)

FEEDBACK FROM TEACHER
Good things:
- Good job importing components into one SASS file. However, at the moment, it seems overcomplicated for the project’s needs. You may want to simplify it or develop additional features that justify the current use of imports
- Promising use of BEM, but there is still room for improvement in its application
- Promising use of variables, but their usage needs to be extended for greater consistency and flexibility
- Promising code readability, but there’s still room for further improvement in clarity and structure
- Good use of semantic HTML
- Good use of contrast and font sizing — it enhances readability and visual hierarchy

To improve:
- Accessibility. The image descriptions could be more human-friendly. Try to describe the illustrations in a simpler, clearer way that reflects their purpose or content

FEEDBACK FROM TEACHER
Thank you for your submission.

Well done — this is a high-quality project with a clear structure, good design, and attention to detail.

The layout, animations, and styling are thoughtfully done and well integrated. Nice work on both A4 and A3 print layouts — everything is readable and well balanced. Well done on ensuring the project looks good on different screen sizes. The responsiveness and layout show great attention to detail.
